### Lessons Learned

Second WordPress project done for RED Academy, Web Development. I was able to implement variables in a more sufficient way, as per the last project which I was not fully capable of doing. I struggled with the JavaScript/jQuery as pect of the project, so this is something I will take time to reflect on and become more proficient in. Overall, a very fun project to complete.
